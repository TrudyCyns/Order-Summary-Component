## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5.1.3

### Continued development

I would like to refine the section before the buttons. Its spacing could be better.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/) - This is where I got the card template. I like the components and will continue to use them.
